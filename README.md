# Gating.jl

Experimental GUI package for gating in Julia.
The main idea is to provide an abstract interface that can be implemented by data providers in order to support:

* Flow cytometry data
* Single cell data

Prototyping is done with Single Cell data using [SingleProjections.jl](https://github.com/rasmushenningsson/SingleCellProjections.jl).
